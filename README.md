Challenge Details:
Thank you for checking us out!
The ‘Driving a better way forward’ Challenge is about how to ensure liveable communities
for future generations!
Using the vehicle monitoring system data provided and any other data you can source, think
about how we can create efficiencies to benefit people, planet and productivity.
Background:
Unitywater’s fleet utilises GPS monitoring systems. Each year, Unitywater drives over 3.9
million kilometres to serve our region which stretches from Noosa to Moreton Bay. Our team
members live throughout our region, Brisbane and as far south as the Gold Coast.
Supporting information for the Unitywater Challenge
The dataset provided is a 1-month extract from Unitywater’s vehicle monitoring system
installed in over 280 trucks and vehicles. Specifically, the dataset provided is June 2023 –
a typical month in the life of Unitywater team members with no emergency events.
Some team members start and finish their work day at Unitywater service centres and
depots. Other team members have been allocated vehicles and start & finish their assigned
jobs from home. These home addresses have been rolled up to Suburb level to protect
privacy.
You might use this data to showcase your ideas related to people, planet, productivity and
plant impacts in the following ways:
• Identify efficiencies and potential benefits
• Analyse patterns
• Can we reduce our environmental foot print?
• Can we improve our community liveability?
We are so excited to hear your ideas and look forward to working with you over the next 48
hours!
